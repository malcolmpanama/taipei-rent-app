Edit
Looking at your error, the issue is that you're using the deprecated choropleth_mapbox function with the fitbounds="locations" parameter, but the newer Plotly version expects bounds instead of fitbounds in the mapbox configuration.

Here's the fix for your code:


Fixed Taipei Rent App
Code 
The key changes I made to fix your error:

Updated to choropleth_map: Changed from the deprecated px.choropleth_mapbox to px.choropleth_map
Fixed parameter name: Changed mapbox_style to map_style
Removed invalid fitbounds: Removed the mapbox=dict(fitbounds="locations") from update_layout()
Added proper fitbounds: Used fig.update_geos(fitbounds="locations") instead
The error occurred because:

choropleth_mapbox is deprecated and being phased out
The newer mapbox layout structure doesn't support fitbounds as a direct parameter
The correct way to fit bounds is using update_geos(fitbounds="locations") for the new choropleth_map function
Your app should now run without the ValueError!




is workiong but th map is in africa now

Edit
The issue is that choropleth_map uses a different coordinate system than choropleth_mapbox. Let's fix this by either going back to the mapbox version with the correct bounds parameter, or properly configuring the new version:


Fixed Taipei Rent App
Code ∙ Version 2 
I've reverted to using choropleth_mapbox but fixed the bounds issue properly. The key changes:

Back to choropleth_mapbox: This works better with coordinate systems like your Taipei data
Proper bounds calculation: Using gdf.total_bounds to get the actual geographic extent of your Taipei districts
Correct bounds format: Using the proper bounds dictionary structure with west, east, south, north parameters
This should now show your map centered on Taipei instead of defaulting to Africa. The total_bounds method gets the actual geographic boundaries of your GeoDataFrame, ensuring the map focuses on the Taipei area.

the map looks like this is it possibel to zoom out a bit so i can see all taiipe and also not make it rectangular i neet to see more up and belo form what im seeing right now

Edit
Yes! Let's adjust the map to show all of Taipei with better vertical coverage and some padding around the edges. Here's the fix:


Fixed Taipei Rent App
Code ∙ Version 3 
The changes I made:

Added padding: Added 0.01 degrees of padding around all edges so you can see the complete districts and some context around Taipei
Extra vertical padding: Added 1.5x padding on the top and bottom (north and south) to give you more vertical view
Increased height: Bumped the map height from 600px to 700px to give more vertical space and reduce the rectangular/stretched appearance
This should now show:

All of Taipei's districts completely visible
Some surrounding area for context
Better proportions with more vertical space
Less cramped/rectangular appearance
The map should now be zoomed out enough to see all districts clearly while maintaining good detail!




not enoug , need to zoom oyut way more , the top and botton ar stilll cut out

Edit
Let's add much more padding to really zoom out and show the full Taipei area:


Fixed Taipei Rent App
Code ∙ Version 4 
I've significantly increased the padding:

Horizontal padding: 0.05 degrees (5x more than before)
Vertical padding: 0.08 degrees (8x more than before)
This should now show much more area around Taipei, giving you a properly zoomed-out view where you can see all districts completely without any cutoff at the top or bottom. The map should now include plenty of surrounding context and breathing room!




still more verticall space need it both top and bottom

Edit
Let's add even more vertical padding:


Fixed Taipei Rent App
Code ∙ Version 5 
I've nearly doubled the vertical padding from 0.08 to 0.15 degrees. This should give you significantly more space both above and below Taipei, ensuring nothing gets cut off at the top or bottom of the map view!




more , tripleof what you ddi

Edit

Fixed Taipei Rent App
Code ∙ Version 6 
Perfect! I've tripled the vertical padding from 0.15 to 0.45 degrees. This should now give you a very zoomed-out view with tons of vertical space both above and below Taipei, ensuring you can see the complete districts with plenty of breathing room!




image.png
still cuitting out both toip and bottom can you expand the box verically? sop everuything fit?

Edit
Let's make the vertical padding even more extreme to ensure everything fits:


Fixed Taipei Rent App
Code ∙ Version 7 
I've made two major changes:

Extreme vertical padding: Increased from 0.45 to 0.8 degrees (almost doubled again)
Taller map: Increased height from 700px to 800px
This should now give you a very zoomed-out view with massive amounts of space above and below Taipei, ensuring nothing gets cut off at the top or bottom!




aLMOST THERER MAKE IT 8 TIMES NOW

Edit

Fixed Taipei Rent App
Code ∙ Version 8 
Perfect! I've multiplied the vertical padding by 8 - from 0.8 to 6.4 degrees. This should now give you an extremely zoomed-out view with massive amounts of vertical space both above and below Taipei, ensuring everything fits perfectly within the map boundaries!




YOU WENT TO fAR AND NOT TAIPEI IS NOT ON THE MAP

Edit
Oops! Let me dial it back to a more reasonable amount:


Fixed Taipei Rent App
Code ∙ Version 9 
You're right, 6.4 was way too much! I've brought it back down to 0.2 degrees of vertical padding, which should show Taipei properly while still giving you enough space above and below to see the complete districts without cutoff.
